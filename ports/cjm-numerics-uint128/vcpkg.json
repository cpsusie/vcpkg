  "description": [
      "a header-only library for C++ 20 that provides an unsigned 128-bit integer.",
      "This library provides constexpr support for most operations but uses std::is_constant_evaluated to ensure that a more efficient operation, if available, is used during runtime execution.  This uint128 type can serve as the basic building block for future fixed-but-extended-precision integral and rational types."
